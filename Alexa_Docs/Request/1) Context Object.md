### Context object[](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#context-object)

The `context` object provides your skill with information about the current state of the Alexa service and device at the time the request is sent to your service. This is included on all requests. For requests sent in the context of a session (`CanFulfillIntentRequest`, `LaunchRequest` and `IntentRequest`), the `context` object duplicates the `user` and `application` information that is also available in the `session` object.

|Property|Description|Type|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`apiAccessToken`|Contains a token that can be used to access Alexa-specific APIs. This token encapsulates:<br><br>- Any permissions the user has consented to, such as permission to access the user's address with the [Device Settings API](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/device-settings-api-reference.html).<br>- Access to other Alexa-specific APIs, such as the [Progressive Response API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/send-the-user-a-progressive-response.html)<br><br>This token is included in all requests sent to your skill. When using this token to access an API that requires permissions, your skill should call the API and check the return code. If a `403` (access denied) code is returned, your skill can then take appropriate actions to request the permissions from the user.|`string`|
|`apiEndpoint`|References the correct base URI to refer to by region, for use with APIs such as the [Device Settings API](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/device-settings-api-reference.html) and [Progressive Response API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/send-the-user-a-progressive-response.html).|`string`|
|`application`|Contains an application ID. Use the ID to verify that the request was intended for your service:<br><br>- `applicationId`: A `string` representing the application ID for your skill.<br><br>This information is also available in the `session.application` property for `CanFulfillIntentRequest`, `LaunchRequest`, `IntentRequest`, and `SessionEndedRequest` types.<br><br>The application ID is displayed in the developer console. You can see it when you pick **AWS Lambda ARN** on the **Custom > Endpoint** page. It is also shown below the skill name in your [list of skills](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask "Alexa Developer Console").|`object`|
|`device`|Provides information about the device used to send the request. The `device` object contains the following properties:<br><br>- The `deviceId` property uniquely identifies the device.<br>- The `supportedInterfaces` property lists each interface that the device supports. For example, if `supportedInterfaces` includes `AudioPlayer {}`, then you know that the device supports streaming audio using the [AudioPlayer interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html).<br>- The `persistentEndpointId` property is a persistent identifier for the endpoint from which the skill request is issued. An _endpoint_ represents an Alexa-connected device (such as an Echo device or a smart light bulb) or a device-like entity (such as a scene or a specific application running on a device). For details about endpoints, see [Endpoint API](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-smart-properties/alexa-for-residential-endpoint-api.html). Only registered [Alexa Smart Properties for residential](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-for-residential) and [Alexa Smart Properties for hospitality](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-for-hospitality) vendors can see the **Read PersistentEndpointId** toggle in the Alexa developer console. This identifier is vendor-based and all skills that belong to particular vendor share this identifier.|`object`|
|`unit`|Represents a logical construct organizing actors (such as people and organizations) and resources (such as devices and skills) that interact with Alexa systems.<br><br>A `unit` is composed of:<br><br>- `unitId`: A string that represents a unique identifier for the unit in the context of a request. The length of this identifier can vary, and there's no restriction on the number of characters it can have. Alexa generates this string only when a request made to your skill has a valid unit context. Normally, disabling and re-enabling a skill generates a new identifier.<br>    <br>- `persistentUnitId`: A string that represents a unique identifier for the unit in the context of a request. The length of this identifier can vary, but is never more than 255 characters. Alexa generates this string only when the request made to your skill has a valid unit context. This is another unit identifier associated with an organization's developer account. Only registered [Alexa Smart Properties for residential](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-for-residential) and [Alexa Smart Properties for hospitality](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-for-hospitality) vendors can see the **Read PersistentUnitId** toggle in the Alexa skills developers console. This identifier is vendor-based and all skills that belong to particular vendor share this identifier.|`object`|
|`person`|Describes the person who is making the request to Alexa. The `person` object is different than the `user` object, because `person` refers to a user whom Alexa recognizes by voice, whereas `user` refers to the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled.<br><br>A `person` is composed of:<br><br>- `personId`: A string that represents a unique identifier for the person who is making the request. The length of this identifier can vary, and there's no restriction on the number of characters it can have. Alexa generates this string when a recognized speaker makes a request to your skill. Normally, disabling and re-enabling a skill generates a new identifier.<br>    <br>- `accessToken`: A token identifying the person in another system. This field only appears in the request if the person has successfully linked their account with their Alexa profile.<br>    <br><br>The `accessToken` field will not appear if null.|`object`|
|`user`|Describes the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled. The `user` object is different than the `person` object, because `user` refers to the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled, whereas `person` refers to a user whom Alexa recognizes by voice.<br><br>A `user` is composed of:<br><br>- `userId`: A string that represents a unique identifier for the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled. The length of this identifier can vary, and there's no restriction on the number of characters it can have. Alexa automatically generates the `userId` when a user enables the skill in the Alexa app. Normally, disabling and re-enabling a skill generates a new identifier. However, if the skill offers _consumable_ purchases, the `userId` is _not_ reset. See [Maintain the user inventory if the user disables and re-enables the skill](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/in-skill-purchase/add-isps-to-a-skill.html#maintain-inventory).<br>    <br>- `accessToken`: A token identifying the user in another system. This token is only provided if the user has successfully linked their account. See [Understand Account Linking](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/account-linking/understand-account-linking.html) for more details.<br>    <br>- `permissions`: Deprecated. An object that contains a `consentToken` allowing the skill access to information that the customer has consented to provide, such as address information. Because `consentToken` is deprecated, instead use the `apiAccessToken` available in the [`context` object](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#context-object) to determine the user's permissions. See [Permissions](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/configure-permissions-for-customer-information-in-your-skill.html) for more details.<br>    <br><br>The `accessToken` field does not appear if null, and the `permissions` object also does not appear if `consentToken` is null.<br><br>This information is also available in the `session.user` property for [`LaunchRequest`](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-types-reference.html#launchrequest), [`IntentRequest`](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-types-reference.html#intentrequest), and [`SessionEndedRequest`](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-types-reference.html#sessionendedrequest) types.|
