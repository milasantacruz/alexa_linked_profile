[Standard request types](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-types-reference.html) (`CanFulfillIntentReqeuest`, `LaunchRequest`, `IntentRequest`, and `SessionEndedRequest`) include the `session` object. The [`GameEngine` interface][game-engine-interface-reference] includes a `session` object also.

Requests from interfaces such as [AudioPlayer](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html) and [PlaybackController](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/playback-controller-interface-reference.html) are not sent in the context of a session, so they do not include the `session` object. The `context.System.user` and `context.System.application` objects provide the same user and application information as the same objects within `session` â€“ see [Context object](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#context-object).

  
|Property|Description|Type|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`new`|Indicates whether this is a new session. Returns `true` for a new session or `false` for an existing session.|`boolean`|
|`sessionId`|Represents a unique identifier per a user's active session.<br><br>**Note:** A `sessionId` is consistent for multiple subsequent requests for a user and session. If the session ends for a user, then a new unique `sessionId` value is provided for subsequent requests for the same user.|`string`|
|`attributes`|Map of key-value pairs. The attributes map is empty for requests where a new session has started with the property `new` set to `true`.<br><br>- The `key` is a string that represents the name of the attribute. Type: `string`<br>- The `value` is an object that represents the value of the attribute. Type: `object`<br><br>When returning your [response](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#response-format), you can include data you need to persist during the session in the `sessionAttributes` property. The attributes you provide are then passed back to your skill on the next request.|`map`|
|`application`|Contains an application ID. This is used to verify that the request was intended for your service:<br><br>- `applicationId`: A `string` representing the application ID for your skill.<br><br>This information is also available in the `context.System.application` property.<br><br>To see the application ID for your skill, navigate to the list of skills and click the **View Skill ID** link for the skill.|`object`|
|`user`|Describes the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled. The `user` object is different than the `person` object, because `user` refers to the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled, whereas `person` refers to a user whom Alexa recognizes by voice.<br><br>A `user` is composed of:<br><br>- `userId`: A string that represents a unique identifier for the Amazon account for which the skill is enabled. The length of this identifier can vary, and there's no restriction on the number of characters it can have. Alexa automatically generates the `userId` when a user enables the skill in the Alexa app. Normally, disabling and re-enabling a skill generates a new identifier. However, if the skill offers _consumable_ purchases, the `userId` is _not_ reset. See [Maintain the user inventory if the user disables and re-enables the skill](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/in-skill-purchase/add-isps-to-a-skill.html#maintain-inventory).<br>    <br>- `accessToken`: A token identifying the user in another system. This token is only provided if the user has successfully linked their account. See [Understand Account Linking](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/account-linking/understand-account-linking.html) for more details.<br>    <br>- `permissions`: Deprecated. An object that contains a `consentToken` allowing the skill access to information that the customer has consented to provide, such as address information. Because `consentToken` is deprecated, instead use the `apiAccessToken` available in the [`context` object](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#context-object) to determine the user's permissions. See [Permissions](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/configure-permissions-for-customer-information-in-your-skill.html) for more details.<br>    <br><br>The `accessToken` field does not appear if null, and the `permissions` object also does not appear if `consentToken` is null.<br><br>This information is also available in the `context.System.application` property.|
