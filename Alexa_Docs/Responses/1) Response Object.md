|Property|Description|Type|Required|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|`outputSpeech`|Speech to render to the user. See [OutputSpeech Object](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#outputspeech-object).|`object`|No|
|`card`|Card to render to the Amazon Alexa App. See [Card Object](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#card-object).|`object`|No|
|`reprompt`|`OutputSpeech` to use if a re-prompt is necessary.<br><br>Used if your service keeps the session open after sending the response ([`shouldEndSession`](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#shouldEndSession) is `false`), but the user doesn't respond with anything that maps to an intent defined in your voice interface while the microphone is open. The user has a few seconds to respond to the reprompt before Alexa closes the session.<br><br>If the `reprompt` doesn't have a value, Alexa doesn't reprompt the user.|`object`|No|
|`shouldEndSession`|Indicates what should happen after Alexa speaks the response:<br><br>- `true`: The session ends.<br>- `false` or `null`: Alexa opens the microphone for a few seconds to listen for the user's response. Include a [`reprompt`](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#reprompt-object) to give the user a second chance to respond.<br>- `undefined`: The session's behavior depends on the type of Echo device. If the device has a screen and the skill displays screen content, the session stays open for up to 30 more seconds, without opening the microphone to prompt the user for input. For details, see [How devices with screens affect the skill session](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/manage-skill-session-and-session-attributes.html#screen-session). If the user speaks and precedes their request with the wake word (such as "Alexa,") Alexa sends the request to the skill. Otherwise, Alexa ignores the user's speech. If an Alexa Gadgets event handler is active, the session continues to stay open until the skill calls [`CustomInterfaceController.StopEventHandler`](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-gadgets-toolkit/receive-custom-event-from-gadget.html#stop) or the event handler expires.<br><br>Responses to `AMAZON.StopIntent` must use `true`.|`Boolean`|No|
|`directives`|List of _directives_ specifying device-level actions to take using a particular interface, such as the `AudioPlayer` interface for streaming audio. For details about the directives you can include in your response, see:<br><br>- [Alexa.Presentation.APL Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-presentation-language/apl-interface.html)<br>    <br>- [Alexa.Presentation.APLT Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-presentation-language/aplt-interface.html)<br>    <br>- [Alexa.Presentation.HTML Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/web-api-for-games/alexa-presentation-html-interface.html)<br>    <br>- [AudioPlayer Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html)<br>    <br>- [Connections Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/use-skill-connections-to-request-tasks.html)<br>    <br>- [Dialog Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/dialog-interface-reference.html)<br>    <br>- [VideoApp Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/videoapp-interface-reference.html)|`array`|No|
